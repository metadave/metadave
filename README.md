### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a manager of data operations SRE @ Mozilla (as of August 2020)
  - previously, manager of cloud engineering @ Mozilla
- 🌱 I’m currently learning type theory + abstract algebra
- I'm interested in:
	- distributed systems
	- programming language theory + functional programming
	- operating system internals
	- infrastructure automation
	- diversity + inclusion + equity
	- polyglot software development
	  - I ♥️ Haskell, Erlang, F#, OCaml / SMLNJ, Racket, Idris, C, Rust
	  - I use Bash, Python, Terraform, Go, Swift, C++, Java, etc.
	- parsing + compilers
	- math + 3d geometry
- Remote worker since 2012
- 💬 Reach out to me if you're looking for a mentor. In particular, I'm looking to use my energy to help BIPOC, Latinx, LGBTQIA+ folks and women in tech. I can be reached at my github username at protonmail.com. I realize that your professional experience won't be the same as mine, but I'd like to help however I can.
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- I'm **not** a web developer, but I use a lot of backend web tech to host large websites in the cloud.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
  - compilers + language runtimes
  - cloud infrastructure tooling
  - audio / synth stuff
    - I used to [play guitar](https://vimeo.com/259783641)
